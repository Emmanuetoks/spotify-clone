### *Disclaimer*
This project is a spotify-clone I built for practice. It is not in anyway used for commercial purposes or attempts to impersonate the original **Spotify** company. 

## Getting Started
- Download the starter code included in this repository.
- Download the starter code for the [backend](https://github.com/Emmanuetoks/spotify-clone-backend). The backend is required in order to fetch the data that will be displayed in the website.
- Run the code in both the frontend and the backend by executing```npm run dev``` in the terminal.

## How it Works
The website is inspired by the [spotify music player](https://open.spotify.com) website's design and has many of it's functionalities. You can create playlists by clicking on the add button in the **Your Library** section. This will create a new temporary playlist which will not be saved in a database. 

The homepage contains a list of playlists. Each playlist links to a page that shows detailed information about it. 

The play button on each spotify playlist plays the first song on each playlist

The website has a web player that i built which works in tandem with the green button on each playlist card.
